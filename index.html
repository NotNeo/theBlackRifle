	<h1>What the hell is a AR-15?!</h1>

		<p>The AR-15 is a lightweight, intermediate cartridge magazine-fed, air-cooled rifle with a rotating lock bolt, actuated by direct impingement gas operation or long/short stroke piston operation. It has been produced in many different versions, including numerous semi-automatic and select fire variants. It is manufactured with extensive use of aluminum alloys and synthetic materials.</p>

		<h3><center>Contrary to popular belief, AR does <u>not</u> mean assault rifle.</center></h3>
